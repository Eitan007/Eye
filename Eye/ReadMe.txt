Server Name: the server name, never forget the name you used because you will keep using it.

>>>you must REGISTER new SERVERS first before you can use the bot on the server<<<


START/TRAIN server: 
type in the server name then click start/train

in "start" the bot checks for new members joined in server and send a notification to you on discord.
in "train" the bot continously scans for unfamiliar usernames and saves them.

sometimes chrome helps you inject the bot. if it does not do that, click on inject (once) to inject bot manually.
you don't need to type in anything before you can use inject.


STOP:
click STOP to stop the bot on that particular tab
